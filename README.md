# Town Clean-Room

Town Clean-Room is an evidence-driven implementation of a durable personal AI operating system. It reconstructs externally observable product behavior using public documentation and authenticated production observations. It does not contain, claim to contain, or attempt to extract Town's private source code.

## Rules

- Observed behavior and clean-room engineering choices remain explicitly distinguishable.
- Product paths use real persistence and explicit `not_configured` states; they never invent dashboard data.
- External side effects require policy evaluation, idempotency, and an immutable execution record.
- Reverse-engineering captures, personal data, credentials, and investigation notes never enter this repository.
- Each module is verified and pushed independently.

## Development

Requires Node.js 24 and pnpm 10.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm verify
```

The current product objective is recorded in [GOAL.md](./GOAL.md).
